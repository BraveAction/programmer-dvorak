				Tina is on hiatus instead
				The statue is sent to Santa Anita
				This session is tedious on the tendons
				That Thai dish is intense on the sinuses
				Onions stain satin so use this Tide on this
				Dan Addison detonated the thousandth headstone
				Estonian nationhood is a notion hidden in Asia
				The tennis enthusiast hides the dots on his hands
				Otis said that sand is the seed that Isis sent us
				Ted Austin insinuated that Tunisia is in Indonesia
				The Dissonant in the ninth edition hits on the Saudis
				I insist that Adenine is in DNA and that andesine is not
				Deanna and Eddie suntanned on the Tahitian seaside oasis
				Indiana and Ohio do not need donated tissues and headsets
				The attendant initiated an intense sound that suited Odessa
				The dodo added nine and nineteen and attained nine thousand
				Duane nodded to his sis as he situated his sedan in the shade
				Dennis Hudson is hidden in a distant Tunisian hashish hideout
				Nina and Dana hit the astonished attendee on the head in unison
				Auntie Edith tends to hint that Edna heeds the ideas due to Satan
				The idea that nineteen studious Dadaists assisted Einstein is asinine

				Todd hesitated in his Datsun then
				hit the Honda in the side in an instantaneous THUD
				The thesis that Dante dated Death is
				as inane as the attitude that Sade stood on Sadness
				A destitute Sudanese assassin insists
				that sainthood is indeed a handout to heathenish idiots
				A thousand nude deadheads sustained
				hideous headstands as studious atheists dissented and seethed
