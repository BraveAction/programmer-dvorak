				error, orders to torture a geriatric instructor. Though his side has
				surrendered, he continues to oppress and interrogate the retired grandparent.
				The aggressor is arrested, arraigned, tried, and, appropriate to the horrors
				he practiced, prosecuted and incarcerated. The granddaughter, a stenographer,
				nurtures her grandpa, and he recuperates, though his arthritis returns.
				In retrospect, that paragraph incorporated a preposterous R proportion.
